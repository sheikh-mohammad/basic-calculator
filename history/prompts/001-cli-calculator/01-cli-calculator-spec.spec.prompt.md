# PHR: cli-calculator-spec

## Input

```
Let's build basic cli calculator to use basic mathematical operations. For more details; @README.md
```

## Response

Created a comprehensive specification for the CLI calculator feature, including:

- User stories for basic operations, floating-point arithmetic, order of operations, error handling, and clear functions
- Functional requirements covering all mathematical operations, error handling, and UI interactions
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Edge cases for error conditions and complex inputs
- Quality validation checklist

The specification is stored at specs/001-cli-calculator/spec.md and is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

Specification created successfully with all mandatory sections completed. The spec addresses basic mathematical operations, follows BODMAS order of operations, handles errors gracefully, and supports both integer and floating-point arithmetic as specified in the README.
