## Prompt

Use @README.md for reference for constitution

## Response snapshot

Created a Basic Calculator Constitution based on the README.md file. The constitution includes core principles for mathematical accuracy, user input validation, test-first approach, cross-platform compatibility, error handling, and minimalist interface design. It also includes technical constraints and development workflow requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🧪 Tests: No tests added in this task
- 📁 Files: Modified .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with spec, plan, or task creation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides governance framework for future development
